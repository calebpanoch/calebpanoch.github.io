        <h1>BIO:</h1>
        My name is Caleb Panoch. I enjoy most things computer related: anywhere from building them to
        using them for creating things and gaming. Since I was fourteen years old, I have always enjoyed creating my own things with code so I knew that I wanted to go to school for it. I am currently enrolled as a full time student at <span class="fau1">Florida Atlantic University</span> majoring in Computer Science.
